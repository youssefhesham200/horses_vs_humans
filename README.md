# horses_vs_humans with pre_trained model
This project uses Convolutional neural network to classify between Horses and Humans images using Transfer Learning (pre_trained model). 
the Classification is binary and InceptionV3 is used as pretrained model.
using pre_trained model led to high accuracy with only 1 epoch
it will be easy to Run this project on colab
